Thanks for checking this project out! You can do whatever you want with it, even use it for commerical projects, just don't sell it, ok? Also, do not hold us liable for anything if you're using it. It's free, you're getting what you paid for.

If you’re looking for a free (“free” as in “air”) template to slap up while you get ready to launch your next project, look no further. A friend of mine and I recently slapped together a template for you – and your friends – to download.

Here are some things to know about this template:

- It’s totally free. You can use it for commercial purposes. Yes, you can remove our names from the footer (if you must).
- The template uses Twitter Bootstrap to help make it awesome and responsive. It should look great on any sized screen.
- The template comes with a demo message up on top. It’s super easy to remove, so don’t worry.
- The template uses Google Fonts and Font Awesome.
- Special thanks to IronSummitMedia without whom we would not have been able to include the responsive navbar
- The contact form does work, you just need to rename the file mentioned in the contact form section of sky.js. Please take note: the script does not include any sanitization or security - use at your own risk.

Enjoy it, share it, put it to good use. Let me know in the comments below if you have any issues with it. I hope to blog about each component of the template in the near future (no promises).
